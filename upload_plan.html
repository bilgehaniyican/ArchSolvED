   - At this stage, the designer is asked to upload a vector drawing of the site plan where the educational building will be designed.<br><br>
   - The file format has to be ".dxf" yet the file name may vary <br><br>
   - Drawing units must be in meters.<br><br>
   - The boundaries should be defined by an enclosed area with the "POLYGON" command.<br><br>
   - The software needs definitions of the site boundaries in the drawing file (.dxf) in specific layer names. <br><br>
   - "siteboundary" and the "setbackboundary" layer names must be used.
